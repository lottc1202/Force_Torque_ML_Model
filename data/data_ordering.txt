The data is structured as follows:

The first three columns is volume-averaged mean fluid velocity normalized using mu/(rho*Diameter)
The fourth column is volume averaged particle volume fraction
Columns 5 to 7 are particle force normalized using 3*pi*mu*Diameter*(magnitude of fluid velocity)
Columns 8 to 10 are particle torque normalized using mu*Diameter*Diameter*(magnitude of fluid velocity)
Column 11 is the weight coefficient for forces used in loss term, viz. 1/mean drag.
Column 12 is the weight coefficient for torque used in loss term, viz. 1/std(transverse torque components).
The remaining columns represent relative location (x,y,z) of 26 nearest neighbors sorted from nearest to farthest.
For example, columns (13,14,15) represent the position of the first nearest neighbor
